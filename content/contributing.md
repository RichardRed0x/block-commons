Block Commons is open for contributions that fit with the current projects and themes. 

* [Crypto Governance Research](https://www.blockcommons.red/crypto-governance-research/overviews/) is open for contributions through the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/crypto-governance-research), but it's probably worth reaching out before starting anything major because the questions are still being refined.

* The [Politeia Decision Support](https://www.blockcommons.red/project/politeia-decision-support/) project hosts content that aims to inform Decred stakeholders about an open Politeia proposal.

* Block Commons also welcomes articles that address some aspect of the "crypto commons" - anything to do with the governance, funding or usage of crypto common pool resources. 

## Navigating the Block Commons Repository

Block Commons is a static site built with Hugo, everything needed to reproduce the website is in the Block Commons [repository](https://github.com/block-commons/block-commons/). 

The content [folder](https://github.com/block-commons/block-commons/tree/master/content) is where the content lives. Creating a new item of content is a case of making a new sub-folder (e.g. in /content/publication for Research Reports or /content/post/ for Articles) and putting an index.md file within that subfolder that contains the text of the piece plus some "front matter" like a title and metadata. Have a look at how existing content is represented in these files and match that, is probably the easiest way to get started.

There are also [folders](https://github.com/block-commons/block-commons/tree/master/content/authors) and files for author profiles which would be created for a new author. 

If you would like to submit something, feel free to reach out on twitter or via email (richard at block commons dot red).
