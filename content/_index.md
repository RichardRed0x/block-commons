Welcome to Block Commons Research and Education. This website showcases the "Peer production on the crypto commons" paper, along with other resources related to governance of the crypto commons (such as data recording the outcome of proposal voting for a variety of projects). 

Much of this work has been funded by the [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f), and much of the content has been informed or inspired by the discussions of the Decred community.
