Richard Red is a pseudonymous character with an interest in human technological and social development. Richard enjoyed some time working as a researcher within various social science Departments before changing pace to live and work on the crypto commons in early 2019. This was facilitated by finding a variety of ways in which he could make useful contributions to the Decred project, which happened to print its own decentralized credits , and distributes some of these to people who work on useful projects.
