_Block Commons Research and Education_ aims to introduce the concept of digital cryptographically-enabled commons to a wider audience, and to further understanding of the phenomena through open data and research methods.

Block Commons is open for contributions that provide observations or insights about the crypto commons. Get in touch if you have something you'd like to include here.

Block Commons is partially funded by the Decred project Treasury, and much of the content displayed here is also supported by the Decred Treasury (e.g. Pi Research, Politeia Digest, Crypto Governance Research). 

If Block Commons had a mission statement, this is where you would find it. It is a place to put things and a place to find things. By putting them here the things are easier to find and look more proper than when they appear in the GitHub repository of a red-faced alien with a joke pseudonym for a name.
